When I build it reproducibly with Nix, I get signal 7 during execution.
At the moment the proot binary was built directly on-device in Termux.
Sorry about that mess.

Outline:

* Download and compile libtalloc
* Collect .o files into an .a static library
* Compile proot with termux patches with:
    * LDFLAGS += -L ../../talloc-2.1.14/
    * LDFLAGS += -Wl,-Bstatic -ltalloc -Wl,-Bdynamic

I'd be grateful if somebody could help me fix it
